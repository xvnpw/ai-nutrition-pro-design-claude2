# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Client -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker performs DDoS attack on API Gateway to make it unavailable | Denial of Service | API Gateway is exposed to the internet, so it's vulnerable to DDoS attacks unless properly protected | Implement DDoS protection like AWS Shield, Cloudflare, limiting requests per client | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker bypasses authentication by exploiting vulnerability in Kong API Gateway | Spoofing | If Kong is not updated or misconfigured, authentication can be bypassed | Keep Kong updated, follow security best practices for Kong configuration | High |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker sends malformed input to try to exploit vulnerabilities in data parsing | Tampering | API Gateway parses input data, so it's vulnerable to issues like SQLi, XSS unless properly coded | Validate and sanitize all inputs in API Gateway | Medium |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API Gateway to bypass authentication | Spoofing | API Gateway is hardened and follows security best practices, making this unlikely | Keep API Gateway patched and follow security best practices like input validation, rate limiting, etc. | Medium |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker sends malformed requests to API Application, causing denial of service | Denial of Service | API Gateway provides input validation and limits requests, reducing this risk | Implement additional input validation in API Gateway and alert on spikes in invalid requests | Low |
| 3 | Network | Attacker intercepts traffic between API Gateway and API Application to steal or manipulate data | Tampering | Traffic is encrypted over HTTPS, mitigating this | Ensure use of TLS 1.2+ for encryption between components | Low |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API Application to execute arbitrary code and access API Database | Spoofing | API Application is exposed to the internet, increasing attack surface. Need to ensure it is securely coded without vulnerabilities. | Perform security reviews, static analysis, fix vulnerabilities before deploying API Application. Restrict network access to database. | High |
| 2 | API Database | Attacker exploits weak authentication to gain unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | Database stores sensitive data. Proper access controls need to be implemented. | Enforce strong authentication and least privilege access to database. Restrict network access. | High |
| 3 | Network | Attacker intercepts traffic between API Application and API Database to steal or modify data | Tampering | Traffic goes over network and can be intercepted. | Encrypt network traffic using TLS. Authenticate traffic origin. | High |
| 4 | API Application | Excessive load on API Application causes denial of service for API Database | Denial of Service | API Application is exposed to the internet, prone to DoS attacks. | Implement rate limiting, auto-scaling in API Application. Monitor performance. | Medium |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Elevation of privilege due to weak authentication allows attacker to access Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is mitigated by requiring strong authentication for Web Control Plane access. | Enforce strong authentication (MFA) and authorization controls for Web Control Plane access. | High |
| 2 | Control Plane Database | SQL injection allows attacker to extract sensitive data from Control Plane Database | Tampering | This threat is partially mitigated by input validation in Web Control Plane, but additional protections are needed. | Implement SQL sanitization and parameterized queries in Web Control Plane when querying Control Plane Database. | High |
| 3 | Control Plane Database | Denial of service attack against Control Plane Database causes outage | Denial of Service | This threat is not mitigated currently. | Implement network firewall rules and WAF to detect and block DoS attacks against Control Plane Database. | Medium |
| 4 | Control Plane Database | Unauthorized access to Control Plane Database allows data theft | Information Disclosure | This threat is partially mitigated by network security controls, but database-level protections are needed. | Enforce principle of least privilege and implement database encryption to protect confidentiality of Control Plane Database. | Medium |


### Data flow 5: API Application -> ChatGPT

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker could send malicious prompts to ChatGPT that cause it to respond with harmful content | Tampering | This threat is partially mitigated by input filtering in API Gateway, but additional controls are needed in API Application | Implement additional input validation and sanitization in API Application before sending requests to ChatGPT | High |
| 2 | API Application | Excessive requests to ChatGPT could degrade performance or cause downtime | Denial of Service | This threat is partially mitigated by rate limiting in API Gateway, but additional controls are needed in API Application | Implement rate limiting and request throttling in API Application | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | ChatGPT responses could expose sensitive data provided in prompts | Information Disclosure | This threat is not mitigated currently | Scrub any sensitive data from prompts before sending to ChatGPT | High |
| 4 | API Application | Lack of TLS could allow eavesdropping of API requests/responses | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated because communication uses HTTPS | Continue using HTTPS for all API communication | Low |
