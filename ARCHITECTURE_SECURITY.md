# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Meal Planner -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Meal Planner | Attacker performs SQL injection on Meal Planner and extracts sensitive data from API Gateway | Spoofing | This threat is mitigated because all user inputs are sanitized before being passed to the API Gateway | Input validation and sanitization | Low |
| 2 | Meal Planner | Attacker bypasses authentication in Meal Planner and makes unauthorized requests to API Gateway | Spoofing | This threat is applicable because authentication has not been implemented in Meal Planner yet | Implement authentication and authorization in Meal Planner | High |
| 3 | Network | Attacker intercepts traffic between Meal Planner and API Gateway and steals sensitive information | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated because all traffic is encrypted using HTTPS | Use HTTPS for encryption | Low |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker bypasses authentication in API Gateway and gains unauthorized access to API Application | Spoofing | API Gateway should implement proper authentication and authorization | Implement strong authentication in API Gateway. Use OAuth2.0 or API Keys. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker sends malformed input to API Application causing buffer overflow | Tampering | API Gateway should filter and validate input | Implement input validation and filtering in API Gateway | Medium |
| 3 | Network | Attacker intercepts traffic between API Gateway and API Application and steals sensitive data | Information Disclosure | Network traffic should be encrypted | Use TLS for traffic between API Gateway and API Application | High |
| 4 | API Application | API Application has vulnerability that allows RCE when exploited by attacker sending crafted input via API Gateway | Tampering | Proper input validation in API Gateway and hardening of API Application | Filter and validate input in API Gateway. Harden API Application, keep dependencies up-to-date. | Critical |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API Application to execute arbitrary code and access API database | Tampering | This threat is mitigated by security testing and patching of API Application | Perform security testing, code reviews, and use infrastructure as code for API Application deployment. Follow security best practices for Golang. Apply security patches in a timely manner. | High |
| 2 | API database | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API database to gain unauthorized data access | Information Disclosure | This threat is partially mitigated by database access controls and encryption. However, vulnerabilities may exist. | Use database encryption and access controls. Perform security testing and apply patches for API database. Restrict database network access. | High |
| 3 | Network | Attacker intercepts traffic between API Application and API database to steal or manipulate data | Tampering | This is mitigated by use of TLS for encryption. | Continue using TLS for encryption between API Application and API database. | Medium |
