# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Client -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker performs DDoS attack on API Gateway to make it unavailable | Denial of Service | API Gateway is exposed to internet, so DDoS attack is possible. | Implement DDoS protection like AWS Shield, Cloudflare. Monitor traffic and block attacking IPs. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker sends malformed requests to API Gateway to trigger errors and disrupt service | Denial of Service | API Gateway parses incoming requests, so malformed requests can trigger errors. | Input validation and sanitization. Monitor error rates. | Medium |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker exploits known vulnerability in API Gateway to gain unauthorized access | Spoofing | If API Gateway has known vulnerability, it can be exploited. | Keep API Gateway up-to-date. Perform security scans. | High |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker bypasses authentication in API Gateway and gains unauthorized access to API Application | Spoofing | API Gateway provides authentication, so this threat is mitigated unless authentication is poorly implemented | Use strong authentication mechanisms in API Gateway like OAuth 2.0. Implement role-based access control. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker sends malformed input to API Application, causing buffer overflow or code injection | Tampering | API Gateway provides input filtering, so this threat is mitigated unless filtering is poorly implemented | Implement strong input validation and sanitization in API Gateway. Use allowlists instead of denylists. | High |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker steals API keys/secrets from API Gateway and makes unauthorized requests to API Application | Spoofing | This threat is applicable since API keys are stored in API Gateway | Store API keys securely using a secrets manager. Implement key rotation. Monitor for suspicious activity. | High |
| 4 | API Gateway | Attacker performs DDoS attack on API Gateway, disrupting availability of API Application | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable since API Gateway is exposed to the internet | Implement rate limiting in API Gateway. Have DDoS mitigation service. Follow resilience best practices. | High |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API Application to execute arbitrary code and access API Database | Tampering | This threat is mitigated by security testing and patching of API Application | Perform security testing, code reviews, and use infrastructure as code for API Application deployment. Follow security best practices for Golang. Enable WAF rules to detect and block attacks. | High |
| 2 | Network | Attacker performs MITM attack and intercepts traffic between API Application and API Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated by network encryption | Use TLS 1.2 or higher for encryption between API Application and API Database. | Medium |
| 3 | API Database | Attacker exploits vulnerability in API Database to gain unauthorized access | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated by security hardening of API Database | Use security groups, IAM roles and encryption at rest for API Database. Follow AWS security best practices. | High |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Elevation of privilege due to weak authentication allows attacker to gain unauthorized access | Spoofing | This threat is mitigated by requiring strong authentication for access | Enforce strong authentication and access controls for Web Control Plane | High |
| 2 | Control Plane Database | SQL injection allows unauthorized data access or manipulation | Tampering | This threat is applicable since user input is used in queries | Validate and sanitize all user input before using in database queries | High |
| 3 | Network | Man-in-the-middle attack intercepts data in transit | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated by use of TLS | Enforce TLS for all network communication | Medium |
| 4 | Control Plane Database | Unauthorized access to database allows data theft | Information Disclosure | This threat is mitigated by access controls | Enforce principle of least privilege and access controls for database | Medium |


### Data flow 5: API Application -> ChatGPT

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker could send malicious prompts to ChatGPT that cause it to respond with harmful content | Tampering | This threat is partially mitigated by input filtering in API Gateway, but additional controls are needed in API Application | Implement additional input validation and sanitization in API Application before sending requests to ChatGPT | High |
| 2 | API Application | Excessive requests to ChatGPT could degrade performance or cause downtime | Denial of Service | Rate limiting in API Gateway provides some protection but limits could be bypassed | Implement rate limiting within API Application based on tenant usage quotas | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Lack of TLS allows eavesdropping of API requests and responses | Information Disclosure | TLS is used to encrypt traffic between API Application and ChatGPT | None, TLS mitigates this threat | Low |
| 4 | API Application | API keys for ChatGPT could be compromised allowing unauthorized access | Spoofing | API keys are stored securely but access is not audited | Enable audit logging of API key access and rotation | Medium |
